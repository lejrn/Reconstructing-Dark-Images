# Reconstructing-Dark-Images
Reconstruct dark images using Neural Networks

# Goals
1. Gathering knowlodge about Deep learning, especially Residual Networks and Unet Networks
2. Programming a neureal network that is trained with dark photos and its pair
3. Optimizing its specifications, as in batch-size, depth of layers, input files sizes, learning rates, and so on
4. Using SID dataset by <insert credits here> and examine our performance to theirs
